  title: "Initial toolchain and policy baseline"
  date: 2025-11-03
  status: accepted
  context: |
    Bootstrap phase established the repository structure, licensing, and
    contribution guidelines for CiviWave-FEM.
  decision: |
    Adopt GCC 15.2, CMake 4.1.2, Vulkan SDK 1.4.328.1, Slang 2025.18, Doxygen
    1.15+, and an AGPL-3.0-or-later license. Require source-first dependency
    policy with CMake FetchContent and mandate mixed-precision matrix-free
    solvers.
  consequences: |
    Contributors must install the specified toolchain versions (or newer) and
    follow the dependency sourcing rules. Documentation, CI, and future modules
    inherit these baselines, including automated Doxygen generation.
  follow_up: |
    Revisit toolchain versions quarterly and update this ADR with rationale for
    upgrades or compatibility constraints.
